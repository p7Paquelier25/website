My father is a very hard working person with a cattle company, farrier company, and a boarding ranch where horse events are held. He has been working as a farrier and a cattle owner for as long as I can remember. He moved to America in 1986 and bought his farrier trailer that he still uses today. He used to live in France, Dijon with both of his parents.
<p>
my father is my hero becuase of how hard working and respectable he is. Usualy he will be the first person that people would ask for help at their branding. Also, he is a highly respected farrier and is very good at his job with a lot of experience.
